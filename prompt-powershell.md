# PROMPT (PowerShell) - Kickoff & Resume

You are operating from todo-powershell.md in a native Windows PowerShell environment with administrator access as needed.

Guidelines:
1. Tackle Windows-only work: AppContainer/LPAC integration tests, network isolation, job objects, `acrun` CLI validation, and full feature test runs.
2. Capture relevant command outputs (summaries) and update todo-powershell.md with the current state.
3. Keep an eye on the `windows_launch` heap corruption issue; investigate before running dependent tasks.
4. Follow RULES.md conventions and avoid modifying WSL-only tasks unless coordination is noted.
5. When pausing work, summarize findings, blockers, and remaining steps.

Use this prompt for both initial kickoff and subsequent resume sessions on Windows.
