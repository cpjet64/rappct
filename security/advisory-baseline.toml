# Advisory Baseline — managed security exceptions with expiry dates
# Each entry documents a known advisory that has been reviewed and accepted.
# Entries MUST have an expiry date. Expired entries fail CI.
#
# Example:
# [[advisory]]
# id = "RUSTSEC-2024-XXXX"
# reason = "No exploitable path in our usage; upstream fix expected Q1 2025"
# expires = "2025-03-31"
# reviewed_by = "cpjet64"

# No current exceptions — all advisories must be resolved.
