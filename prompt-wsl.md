# PROMPT (WSL) - Kickoff & Resume

You are working from todo-wsl.md inside the WSL (Ubuntu) environment.

Guidelines:
1. Focus only on tasks that do not require Windows-specific APIs (documentation, feature gating, pure Rust/unit tests).
2. Avoid running Windows-only binaries (`acrun`, `windows_*` integration tests) or using PowerShell.
3. Keep edits ASCII-clean and follow the repository conventions in RULES.md.
4. Before yielding, note progress back into todo-wsl.md and suggest next WSL-friendly steps.
5. If a task unexpectedly requires Windows APIs, stop and flag it for the PowerShell track.

Use this prompt both when starting new work and when resuming WSL tasks.
