# Plan - coverage-maximizer-round3-2026-02-26

## Goal
Continue maximizing coverage beyond round-2 by targeting remaining high-yield coverable paths while preserving behavior and passing full local gates.

## Steps
- [x] Worktree isolation + rollback/audit init
- [ ] Baseline full coverage + missing-lines inventory
- [ ] Targeted test additions for highest-yield uncovered paths
- [ ] Detailed comments for newly-classified uncoverable branches
- [ ] Verify with just ci-fast and just ci-deep
- [ ] Commit locally (no push)
