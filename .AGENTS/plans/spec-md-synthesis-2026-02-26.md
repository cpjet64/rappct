Task: Write `docs/SPEC.md` using required sections and repository-grounded details.

- [x] Draft each required SPEC section with concrete behavior and constraints.
- [x] Add Mermaid diagrams for architecture and core data/launch flows.
- [x] Verify every major claim against file-level sources.
- [x] Run local doc verification and capture outcomes.
